# Every time I reboot my machine, this apache http daemon starts up, which
# binds to port 80 before launch_socket_server can, which means I can't
# work on GitHub stuff without unloading it and rebooting
# launch_socket_server. I should probably find a way to permanently shut
# off this apache http daemon, but this works for now.

sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist
sudo brew services restart launch_socket_server
