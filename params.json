{"name":"Dotfiles","tagline":"my toolkit with which i will one day conquer the world","body":"# parkr does dotfiles, courtesy of tombell\r\n\r\n## ~ is where the ♥ is\r\n\r\nMy dotfiles were originally a fork of @tombell's dotfiles, which were originally\r\na fork of @holman's dotfiles.\r\n\r\nYour dotfiles are you personalised configuration files for UNIX-like systems,\r\nthey usually reside in your home (`~`) directory.\r\n\r\nLike @tombell's and @holman's, my dotfiles are organised into topics (ruby, git, \r\nzsh etc). For more information about dotfiles and @holman's specifically check out his\r\n[repo][holman-repo] and [blog post][holman-post] on the subject.\r\n\r\n[holman-repo]: https://github.com/holman/dotfiles\r\n[holman-post]: http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n* `git clone git://github.com/parkr/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`\r\n* `cd ~/.dotfiles`\r\n* `git submodule init`\r\n* `git submodule update`\r\n* `rake install`\r\n\r\nThe install rake task will symlink all the correct files from `~/.dotfiles` to\r\nyour home directory. You will want to configure and tweak everything inside the\r\n`~/.dotfiles` directory though.\r\n\r\n## Components\r\n\r\nTaken from @holman's, there are a few special files in the repository:\r\n\r\n* `bin/`, anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and made available\r\n  everywhere\r\n* `<topic>/*.zsh`, any files ending with `.zsh` will get loaded into your\r\n  environment\r\n* `<topic>/*.symlink`, any files ending with `.symlink` will get symlinked into\r\n  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles\r\n  but still keep those autoloaded in your home directory. These get symlinked\r\n  when you run `rake install`\r\n* `<topic>/*.completion.sh`, any files ended in `completion.sh` get loaded last\r\n  so that they get loaded after we set up zsh autocomplete functions\r\n\r\n## Extras\r\n\r\nThere are a few things I use to make my life awesome. They're not a required\r\ndependency, but if you install them they'll make your life more awesome as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n* If you want some more colours for things like `ls`, install `grc`:\r\n  `brew install grc`\r\n* If you want `rvm` or `rbenv` to manage your ruby installs, install either and\r\n  you'll get the current ruby version in your prompt\r\n\r\n## Bug\r\n\r\nJust open an issue and/or pull request.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nI originally forked @tombell's dotfiles, who originally forked @holamn's dotfiles, who originally forked @ryanb's dotfiles.\r\nSo thanks to them.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
